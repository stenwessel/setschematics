# Schematizing Spatial Hypergraphs on Concentric Circles and Grids

Research prototype implementation using simulated annealing.

## Setting up
* Clone the repository, as well as [geometrycore](https://gitaga.win.tue.nl/commons/geometrycore).
Add the geometrycode library as a dependency to the cloned project.
* The project uses gradle as build system and should resolve all other dependencies automatically.
* To run the UI, start from the class `concentricsetschema.gui.Data` (in the `src/main/java` directory).
* Basic parameters for the concentric/rectangular grid can be set in the _Center_ tab.
The simulated annealing prototype can be run from the _SA Prototype_ tab.
  
## Datasets
The datasets are located in the `data` directory.
